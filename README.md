# android-app

This is an Android app I'm developing during the classes I'm teaching in Afeka Academic College of Engineering, TLV.

It demonstrating tools usage for the beginner developer (the student), such as:
* Threads (with UI changes)
* Notifications
* Intent + Activities (intent's extra, other apps' activities, phone call etc.)
* Storage (Shared Preferences, SQLite, custom Content Provider)
