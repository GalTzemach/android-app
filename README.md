# android-app

This is an Android app I'm developing during the classes I'm teaching in [Afeka Academic College of Engineering, TLV](http://english.afeka.ac.il/).

It demonstrates different usages in Android development, such as:
* Intent + Activities (intent's extra, other apps' activities, phone call etc.)
* Threads (with UI changes)
* Storage (Shared Preferences, SQLite, custom Content Provider)
* Animations (View animations, Property animations)
* Bound service
* BroadcastReceiver
* Fragment
* Sensors usage + Mock Sensor
* Local Notifications
