# android-app

This is an Android app I'm developing during the classes I'm teaching in Afeka Academic College of Engineering, TLV.

It demonstrates different usages in Android development for the Java developers (the students), such as:
* Intent + Activities (intent's extra, other apps' activities, phone call etc.)
* Threads (with UI changes)
* Storage (Shared Preferences, SQLite, custom Content Provider)
* Animations
* Notifications
